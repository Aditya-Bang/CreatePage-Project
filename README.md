For my final project, I create a web-based application which allows users to create and style their own webpages.

The inspiration for this webpage was the course itself, I found making webpages difficult and it requires a considerable amount of time, which many people do not have.
My goal for this webpage is to make webpage creation itself much more user friendly and intuative.

How it works:
Users can create an account where they create multiple webpages that are saved in a database.
They first have to create the webpage where they choose the background color, and if they want to enable a navbar for that specific page.
They can add one title at the top of every webpage, choosing styles such as font, color, size, alignment.
They can add text on any of their webpages, choosing styles such as font, color, size, alignment.
They can customize their navbar, choosing color, width, navlink size, font and more.
Each navlink they create can be linked to the webpage of their choosing.
All your webpages will be on display in the websites homepage.

Every aspect of the elements above is easily edited and deleted, making the software as user friendly as possible.
In the future, I plan on improving this website, allowing users to create more interactive and complex webpages with elements such as tables, forms, buttons and images.
