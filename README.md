## CreatePage: Web-Based Application for Webpage Creation
I created a web-based application that allows users to create and style their own webpages easily and intuitively.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from my own experiences in the CS50 course. I found webpage creation challenging and time-consuming, a common issue for many people. My goal with this application is to make the process of creating webpages much more user-friendly and intuitive.

## Features

#### User Accounts:
Users can create accounts, allowing them to create and manage multiple webpages that are saved in a database. All created webpages are displayed on the application's homepage.

#### Webpage Creation:

1. Initial Setup: Users can start by choosing the background color for their webpage and deciding whether to enable a navbar.
2. Title: Each webpage can have a title at the top, with customizable styles including font, color, size, and alignment.
3. Text: Users can add text to their webpages with customizable styles such as font, color, size, and alignment.
4. Navbar Customization: The navbar can be customized in terms of color, width, navlink size, font, and more. Each navlink can be linked to any webpage the user chooses.
5. Editing and Deletion: Every aspect of the elements mentioned above can be easily edited or deleted, ensuring the software is as user-friendly as possible.

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance this application by allowing users to create more interactive and complex webpages, incorporating elements such as tables, forms, buttons, and images.
